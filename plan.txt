(try maxing out the logs and goal name to see if lenght limits are good enough)

Delete goal docs:
As of "mongoose": ">=2.7.1" you can remove the document directly with the .remove() method rather than finding the document and then removing it which seems to me more efficient and easy to maintain.

See example:

Model.remove({ _id: req.body.id }, function(err) {
    if (!err) {
            message.type = 'notification!';
    }
    else {
            message.type = 'error';
    }
});
